# frac-index

Fractional indexing for ordered data structures — coming soon 🧮

---

`frac-index` is a small, blazing-fast library for generating order-preserving indexes between existing values (like between `'a'` and `'b'`, or `'ab'` and `'ac'`).  
Inspired by techniques used in Notion, Figma, and other real-time collaborative editors.

This project aims to provide:

- **Precise fractional indexing** for dynamic lists
- **Type-safe API** with solid error handling
- **Rust core + JS bindings** for max performance
- **Deterministic behavior** for concurrent edits

---

⚙️ **Status:**  
Currently in early development.
